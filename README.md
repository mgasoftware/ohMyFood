##  Project Description

OhMyFood is the development of a "mobile first" website that lists menus from gourmet restaurants. In addition to the traditional reservation systems, customers will be able to compose their meal menu so that the dishes are ready upon their arrival, eliminating waiting times at the restaurant.

The mobile and desktop mock-ups of the site has been made by OpenClassRoom. The mock-ups has been made with Figma, which demonstrates the animations and behaviors to be integrated.

The website is be developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, strictly following the information determined in the mock-ups. It's responsive and "mobile first," with polished animations.
